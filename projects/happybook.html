          <h1>HappyBook</h1>
          <p>
            HappyBook is best described as IMDB for books. Users can search for
            and review a set of books, and save books they have read or want to
            read. Admins can add new books and remove existing ones. Data is
            stored in Firebase, and our backend is still operational. In other
            words, you can still run the application on your device and fully
            explore the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depicted below is the main page of the website. Here the top ten
            books are gathered from the database and shown under "Toppliste". A
            Carousel is showing this week's selected books on the left. This
            list can unfortunately not be updated through the website's admin
            interface. In the navbar a burger menu lets users only display books
            of a certain genre. The HAPPYBOOK button returns from the main page,
            and the search bar naturally lets users search for books. On the
            right there is an avatar icon that takes you to the log-in, user and
            admin pages. Lastly, the button furthest to the right is a darkmode
            toggle.

          </div>
          <p>
            Clcking on one of the Carousel books will show a pop-up with some
            information about the book. From here, users can view more
            information by clicking the link that leads to the "book page". This
            page can naturally also be reached directly by clicking on any other
            book element in HappyBook.

            <img class="projectIntroImg" src="../images/hb/bookpage.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            On the book page, more information about each book can be seen. Here
            users can also save books and write reviews.
          </p>

              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                Reviews were the final feature we implemented. When logged in,
                users can add reviews and delete the ones they have written. As
                shown in the image, admins can delete all reviews.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                As security was not a requirement for this course, users are
                simply identified by the email they used when signing up.

          <p>
            A user's saved books can be viewed on their user page, which can be
            reached by clicking the avatar icon dropdown on the navbar. This
            page shows books the user wishes to read or has read, and the user
            can remove items from these lists by the press of a button. The view
            is perhaps not ideal - all items are stored in a scrollable list. If
            you have many items saved, finding the one you want to remove could
            become cumbersome.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marginTopDefault">Search</h2>
          <div class="projectBody">
            <img src="../images/hb/search.png" />
            <div class="projectWrapper projectFirstInfo">
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                I developed the search function in our project, which is
                something I have never attempted before. It uses a string
                similarity library to best match results with your search. When
                clicking on a result, a book page is dynamically generated based
                on the book's id. Further, a book named 'tittel' can be seen in
                the image. This one has been created manually by an admin using
                the website.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                The window.location.href bar is used to distinguish between
                searches. A search without filters for 'harry' will use the link
                'search/:all/:harry'. Initially 5 items are loaded. Up to 15
                additional elements can be loaded dynamically. This is to limit
                queries.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="videoWrapper">
            <img class="projectIntroImg" src="../images/hb/filtersearch.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Searches using filters will include the chosen filter in the href
            structure. As can be seen here, a search for 'harry' with the filter
            'Fantasy' active creates the search result page
            'search/:fantasy/:harry'. Book pages work similarly, being
            structured as 'books/:title;author'.

                As mentioned, the avatar icon lets users navigate to the login
                page. Here a third option "Admin" is also present. This item is
                only visible to admin users. Naturally the admin page it links
                to also checks whether the user is an admin before loading any
                content. It would not surprise me if this easily can be
                circumvented, however.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                As security was not a requirement, there is no password strength
                measures when creating a user. Since Google's Firebase is used
                for authentication, passwords are stored securely in the
                database. This does not mean that the application is secure,
                however. When testing the application, I advise using a junk
                email and password.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                Also worth mentioning, the log out button is supposed to say
                "Logg ut" and not "Logg inn" here.
              </p>

          <p>
            Registering simply requires a valid email address (does not have to
            exist, just be of the right format) and an arbitrary password.
          </p>

            Admin users have access to a page for creating new books, and
            deleting existing ones. Books are gathered from the database and
            presented in a scrollable list. If the database is large, this is
            definitely not very user friendly. We were under a time crunch,
            however, so we unfortunately had to cut some corners. Newly created
            books are added to the database and can be searched for and given
            reviews just like any other book. A URL for an image can also be
            added to give the book a cover image.
          </p>
          <h2 class="marginTopDefault">Final thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This project was a part of a software development course, and it was
            the first time I worked with React. I put in a lot of hours on this
            project (over a hundred), and it was a lot of fun, but also
            stressful at times. I learned a lot about React (especially hooks
            and components). I also got experience working on both frontend and
            backend. As we had not worked with React before, a lot of the
            development time unfortunately went towards bugfixing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do fear that I perhaps involved myself too much with other
            people's issues during this project. As I ended up working with
            React Router and the backend, I had to go over and change a lot of
            pages after their initial implementation. I unfortunately also ended
            up having to redo quite a lot of frontend work. While I do not enjoy
            redoing other people's code, quite a few pages were left
            half-finished or just not up to par with the design of the rest of
            the application. On multiple ocations I found myself redesigning
            pages as I knew the original authors would not have time to redo
            this before the next demo. A specific element of frustration for me
            was the genre pages never being properly styled, despite being
            "finished" weeks prior. This was an easy fix, but as nobody else
            stepped up to the plate the responsibility once again fell on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have since learned to discuss a definition of done among the group
            before development starts. It would definitely have been beneficial
            for me to have a DoD for HappyBook, as I at times felt like I was
            playing firefighter.

            start' in the appropriate folder. Further instructions linked below.
            Please keep in mind that the application uses some time to load
            items from the database initially.
