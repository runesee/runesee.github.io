            This project was a part of the same architecture course as the
            Peasant Rebellion project. The goal of the project was to make us
            accustomed to Android Studio, LibGDX, and the Android activity
            lifecycle before we started the main project. Even though I knew my
            group would use Kotlin for the main project, I chose to stick with
            Java for this exercise. Moving on from Java to Kotlin later on was
            pretty straightforward, thankfully.

            The user can move the paddle on the left up and down using their
            mouse. The player plays against the computer, which controls the
            right paddle. The right paddle simply moves towards the puck at a
            set speed. First to 21 points wins. The puck is spawned with a
            random direction (it is made sure the angle is not too steep). The
            puck speed is also increased for each time the players hit the puck
            three times in a row, up to a maximum speed. The amount of
            consecutive hits is represented by the number in the top center of
            the screen.
