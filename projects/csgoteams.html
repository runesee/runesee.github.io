          <h1>CSGO Teams</h1>
          <p>
            CSGO Teams is a simple website made by me and my group to learn
            about responsive design and REST-APIs as a part of a university
            course. The page gathers data of professional players in the video
            game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive from a community API. For
            CS:GO players with a keen eye, the data is somewhat outdated.

              data from an API.</b

            The user is presented with one resource at a time â€” one team is
            shown, and they can navigate to the first, last, next, and previous
            items using buttons below. The user can sort teams by ranking or
            alphabetically in both directions.
          </p>
          <div class="videoWrapper">
            <img

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The user can filter teams by players from a selected country,
            display international or single-nationality teams, and view only
            favorite teams. These selections are saved in session storage to
            persist even after reloading the page. The user can mark teams as
            favorites by clicking a star icon. A context keeps track of
            favorites, storing the state in local storage so favorites remain
            even after closing the browser.

                The website is responsive: on mobile, player layout shifts from
                horizontal to vertical, and navigation buttons are centered.
