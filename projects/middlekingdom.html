          <h1>Middle Kingdom mod - Hearts of Iron IV</h1>
          <p>
            Middle Kingdom is a mod I am developing for the video game Hearts of
            Iron IV. HoI4 is a grand strategy game, taking place in the 20th
            century. In an attempt to push the limitations of the game engine,
            and because I personally take interest in ancient history, this mod
            instead takes place from 2010 - 1995 BC. The main focus of the mod
            is the middle kingdom of Egypt and its neighbours - some of the
            first civilizations in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players can choose to contest the balance of power in Mesopotamia,
            or attempt to profit off trade along the North African trade routes.
            The Middle Kingdom mod aims to be lightweight by only having a few
            playable civilizations. What it lacks in terms of options is
            hopefully made up for with the inclusion of alernative paths for
            each civilization to take. To prevent the campaign from going on for
            too long, some historical timelines will be shifted to better fit
            within the window of the campaign. Further, some events from years
            before or after this mod's scope may be introduced within the
            campaign to keep things interesting. A lot of research has gone into
            this mod, however some liberties will be taken both because of
            historical uncertainties and to keep the mod entertaining.

                The Middle Kingdom of Egypt, as it stands around 2010 BC, has
                recently been reunified by Mentuhotep II. Threats from both east
                and south still remain.

                Egypt is nothing without control of the Nile. Will you seek to
                expand your control southward, marching your armies upstreams to
                Kerma's borders? Or will you stand in solidarity, and fight off
                foreign invaders together?

                While the vast Sahara offers protection from the west, the Nile
                delta remains difficult to defend. There are rumors from the
                east of a great empire. Without a regular standing army, only
                you can decide the fate of Egypt.

                A storm is brewing in Mesopotamia. Elam has long quarreled for
                control on the southern banks of the Tigris and Eufrates.

                While the vast Sumerian empire stretches from the Mediterranean
                basin to the Persian gulf, Elam has been pushed out of Susa.
                This great Elamite city laying under foreign control is a dagger
                in the side of our great leader Kindattu.

              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                While they may have occupied the city, Sumer too was weakened by
                the strife. For the future of Elam, Kindattu must return this
                dagger to its Sumerian owners. This Goliat must be felled!

            Developing this mod has been a great learning experience for me. I
            have become acquainted with the scripting language Lua, as well as
            the tools Paint.net and GIMP for editing bitmaps. After over a month
            of developing, I feel I now have a good understanding of the source
            code and what I need to know for the first major milestone, namely
            populating the in-game map with all the relevant countries of the
            ancient world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first large programming project I have taken on all by
            myself, and if everything goes well it will be a mod that me and my
            friends (or anyone else with a copy of HoI4 on Steam) can enjoy. So
            far I have held a couple limited user tests with friends, but there
            still remains much to do. I am giving myself until the end of next
            semester to complete the mod. The project is open-source and can be
            found on GitHub below.
