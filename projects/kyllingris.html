            Kylling&Ris (Chicken&Rice) is a website Ã  la myfitnesspal, which
            lets users search for and register food they have eaten. The website
            allows searching, filtering and sorting a set of data gathered from
            a REST-API containing Norwegian groceries:
            <a href="https://kassal.app/api">Kassal.app</a>. Users kan easily
            register food elements by clicking the related pluss button.
            Afterwards the users can include the weight of the product and
            select a date. The product will then be shown in a table, which
            allows east navigation between dates through a calender. In the
            table users can remove or edit registered elements using the recycle
            bin and pencil icon respectively.

            This game was developed by me and my group members during a software
            architecture course last semester. As a part of the requirements, we
            had to thoroughly consider the architecture of the game before we
            started programming. The game was written in Kotlin using Android
            Studio, and it was the first time I developed a mobile application.
            During the project, I was mainly responsible for the UX and UI
            design. This project was a lot of fun, and we ended up with a game
            that was pretty enjoyable to play (at least in my opinion). A quick
            summary of the game can be viewed on Youtube in the video below.
