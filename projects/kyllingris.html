            Kylling&Ris (Chicken&Rice) is a website Ã  la myfitnesspal, which
            lets users search for and register food they have eaten. The website
            allows searching, filtering and sorting a set of data gathered from
            a REST-API containing Norwegian groceries:
            <a href="https://kassal.app/api">Kassal.app</a>. Users kan easily
            register food elements by clicking the related plus button.
            Afterwards the users can include the weight of the product and
            select a date. The product will then be shown in a table, which
            allows easy navigation between dates through a calender. In the
            table users can remove or edit registered elements using the recycle
            bin and pencil icons, respectively.

            During this project I mainly worked on the frontend. One of the
            requirements for this project was to have a responsive design. While
            we did not follow a mobile-first approach, we did a lot of testing
            to ensure the application worked well on various screen sizes. I
            personally spent a lot of time ensuring the three pages all had
            dynamic, sleek designs. This was a bit tricky as the dynamic loading
            of data would add extra elements to the page, and we used a third
            party component for the dynamic scrollable list.

            <b>
              An interactive calorie counter app using Neo4J and GraphQL to
              store and present 7500 Norwegian groceries gathered from an API.
              Users can log food eaten on specific dates, and the data is saved
              in the database. The design is responsive and works on both mobile
              and larger screens. Made using React, Vite and Typescript.

                mobile. I unfortunately eventually had to give up on this due to

                In the top right you can see we are currently "logged in" as a

                discussed only saving this data in local storage, but figured
                the examinators might not bother creating an account to test our
                app. Therefore it would be better to store all user generated
                data in the database, even if not logged in.

                Security was not prioritized in this project. To us, the app's
                usability was a much greater concern. Further, the application
                was only intended to be running during this project, and the
                course did not specify any security requirements. Passwords were
                therefore stored in cleartext in the database.

            During this project I learned a lot about responsive frontend
            design. It was at times very tedious, and it took a bazillion errors
            before I got it finally right. In the end, we were very happy with
            the design. We decided to use Typescript for this project, as we had
            never used it before. It was not very different from JS, and easy to
            use with React.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I regret is only working on the frontend. While all group
            members would use the Apollo client to view the database content and
            try queries, one person more or less single handedly set up our
            entire backend. We greatly appreciated this at the time, but in
            hindsight it would have been nice to gain more backend development
            experience.
