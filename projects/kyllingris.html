            Kylling&Ris (Chicken&Rice) is a website Ã  la myfitnesspal, which
            lets users search for and register food they have eaten. The website
            allows searching, filtering and sorting a set of data gathered from
            a REST-API containing Norwegian groceries:
            <a href="https://kassal.app/api">Kassal.app</a>. Users kan easily
            register food elements by clicking the related plus button.
            Afterwards the users can include the weight of the product and
            select a date. The product will then be shown in a table, which
            allows easy navigation between dates through a calender. In the
            table users can remove or edit registered elements using the recycle
            bin and pencil icons, respectively.

                  The Application is made with React, Typescript and set up with
                  Vite.
                </li>
                <li>
                  State management using redux. Search settings and the log date
                  are saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uses imported third party components like datepicker-calender
                  and infinite scroll elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uses Neo4j for backend database. Uses GraphQL, Apollo Server
                  and Apollo Client for queries. Approx. 7500 different food
                  objects stored in the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prettier has (mostly) been used during the project to format
                  code. Prettier and Eslint were run on the entire project
                  before the final hand-in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We set up tests for the frontend, and backend is tested
                  (somewhat) in end-to-end test of food search. We also manually
                  tested queries and mutations with Apollo Server sandbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Comments were used during the project to explain the code.

                  Relevant info about food object is shown by searching or in

                  Each food object in search results can be clicked to see more

                <li>
                  Results can be sorted and filtered (allergies, protein and

                <li>
                  Data is saved on the server. If you do not make a user, you
                  are given a guest user so that the data is still saved on the
                  server.

                <li>
                  The database and backend was originally set up on a virtual
                  machine provided by the course staff. As we no longer have
                  access to it, the backend part of the application will not
                  work.

                <li>Added aria-labels to support screen readers.</li>
                <li>
                  Suitable text distance and choice of colours with clear
                  contrast to ensure readability.

                <li>Added text alternatives to non-text content.</li>
                <li>All essential functionality is accessible by keyboard.</li>
                <li>
                  Navigation is simple as the website only consists of three
                  pages.

                <li>We have tried to limit overuse of the div/span tag.</li>

              <ul>

                  Added "Kaloriteller" (Calorie counter) as a sub text in the
                  logo to ensure users understand the purpose of the
                  application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added descriptive help text in the food log when the user has
                  not added any items.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added different styling when components are focused to
                  communicate to the user that the components can be interacted
                  with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The website helps the user avoid errors. It is for instance
                  not possible to add food in the future.
