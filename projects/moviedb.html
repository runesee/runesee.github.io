          <p>
            The MovieDB Project is an application designed to manage a database
            of movies and series. We used Maven and JavaFX. The app provides a
            graphical interface for users to view and interact with a collection
            of multimedia content. The application is also responsive: you can
            resize it and it will dynamically change how many movies are shown
            per row.

                implemented extensive testing in the project, including robot
                tests. Upon building, two robot tests will run through almost
                all functionality in the application, including adding and
                deleting movies.

                In the application, there is extensive input validation when
                adding movies and series. This is covered by the robot tests. We
                also had a good degree of test coverage using unit tests.

          <h2>First release</h2>
          <p>
            In the initial version, the Moviedb app offered a basic JavaFX
            interface that allowed users to add, view, and delete movies in a
            database. Movies were saved locally in a text file, with
            functionality to read and load saved movies upon startup. This
            version also included basic input validation to prevent invalid data
            entries.
          </p>
          <h2>Second release</h2>
          <p>
            The second release replaced the text file storage with JSON,
            allowing automatic saving and deletion of movies within the app.
            This setup removed the need for manual import/export actions and
            allowed for a more seamless user experience. The project was
            modularized, and testing coverage expanded to include most core
            components. We also adopted a systematic workflow using GitLab's
            issues, milestones and Scrum board.
          </p>
          <h2>Final release</h2>
          <p>
            In its final form, the app incorporated feedback from earlier
            versions, enhanced the code with improved practices and warning
            resolutions, and introduced a REST API. New functionality included
            support for series alongside movies, with a revamped UI displaying
            items in a grid format for better organization.
