          <h1>Robotic Ocean Waste Removal: Ghost Nets</h1>
          <p>
            Robotic Ocean Waste Removal: Ghost Nets was an Experts in Teamwork
            project tackling the problem of locating, removing and modelling
            lost fish nets. My team's approach to this problem was an
            interactive web service that leverages data on reported lost fishing
            nets and uses ocean drift modeling (i.e., OpenDrift) to predict
            their locations. Lost fishnets are a global issue that cause
            significant harm to marine ecosystems. We tackled the modelling
            aspect of this problem; The goal of our solution was to "create a
            cost-effective solution that simplifies reporting and locating ghost
            nets, thereby incentivising their retrieval‚Äù.

            On the landing page, already registered fishnets are fetched from
            the database and displayed in the frontend. Lost fishnets can be
            registered by clicking the corresponding button, and filling out the
            location and time of loss. For this proof-of-concept project, the
            application is geographically limited to the Norwegian coast.

            Each net can be clicked, which opens up an information panel with
            further details about the net. Here, the drift path of the net can
            be simulated for 24 hours after its time of registration. If a
            simulation has already been computed, it is fetched from the
            database instead. Simulated drift paths contain a set of "particles"
            for each half-hour timestep. Each timestep can be viewed by
            adjusting the slider.

            The heatmaps help visually showcase the uncertainty of the fishnets'
            drift. In the example simulation above, the net could have beached,
            or continued to drift north.

            Depicted above is an architectural overview of the application. A
            key focus of this project was scalability. Down the line, we wanted
            it to be possible to simulate for longer periods, and, ideally, from
            anywhere around the globe. To achieve this, past simulations are
            stored, and redundancy is removed by rounding location and temporal
            data to reduce the number of unique simulations. Additionally,
            gathering data of lost fishnets from other sources is supported.
            While this proof-of-concept is duly limited, it demonstrates how
            modelling and reporting of lost fishnets could be combined through a
            single, global tool.
