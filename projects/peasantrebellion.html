          <h1>Peasant Rebellion</h1>
          <p>
            Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
            Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying to
            attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay alive
            as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the highest
            possible score. The game ends when the player loses all their lives.
            The player is then prompted if they would like to save their score
            to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade machines, which is
            accessible from the main menu.

            This game was developed by me and my group members during a software
            architecture course last semester. As a part of the requirements, we
            had to thoroughly consider the architecture of the game before we
            started programming. The game was written in Kotlin using Android
            Studio, and it was the first time I developed a mobile application.
            During the project, I was mainly responsible for the UX and UI
            design. This project was a lot of fun, and we ended up with a game
            that was pretty fun to play (at least in my opinion). A quick
            summary of the game can be viewed on Youtube in the video below.

                The Middle Kingdom of Egypt, as it stands around 2010 BC, has
                recently been reunified by Mentuhotep II. Threats from both east

                Egypt is nothing without control of the Nile. Will you seek to
                expand your control southward, marching your armies upstreams to
                Kerma's borders? Or will you stand in solidarity, and fight off
                foreign invaders together?

                While the vast Sahara offers protection from the west, the Nile
                delta remains difficult to defend. There are rumors from the
                east of a great empire. Without a regular standing army, only
                you can decide the fate of Egypt.

                While the vast Sumerian empire stretches from the Mediterranean
                basin to the Persian gulf, Elam has been pushed out of Susa.
                This great Elamite city laying under foreign control is a dagger
                in the side of our great leader Kindattu.

                While they may have occupied the city, Sumer too was weakened by
                the strife. For the future of Elam, Kindattu must return this
                dagger to its Sumerian owners. This Goliat must be felled!

            Developing this mod has been a great learning experience for me. I
            have become acquainted with the scripting language Lua, as well as
            the tools Paint.net and GIMP for editing bitmaps. After over a month
            of developing, I feel I now have a good understanding of the source
            code and what I need to know for the first major milestone, namely
            populating the in-game map with all the relevant countries of the
            ancient world.
