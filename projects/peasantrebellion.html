          <h1>Peasant Rebellion</h1>
          <p>
            Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
            Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying to
            attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay alive
            as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the highest
            possible score. The game ends when the player loses all their lives.
            The player is then prompted if they would like to save their score
            to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade machines, which is
            accessible from the main menu.

            This game was developed by me and my group members during a software
            architecture course last semester. As a part of the requirements, we
            had to thoroughly consider the architecture of the game before we
            started programming. The most prevalent architectural constraints
            were the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Entity-Component-System
            (ECS) patterns. The game was written in Kotlin using Android Studio,
            and it was the first time I developed a mobile application. During
            the project, I was mainly responsible for the UX and UI design (the
            'V' of MVC). This project was a lot of fun, and we ended up with a
            game that was pretty enjoyable to play (at least in my opinion). A
            quick summary of the game can be viewed on Youtube in the video
            below.

                One of my favorite details in Peasant Rebellion is the art
                style. It is inspired by old 8-bit games and Flash games like
                Age of War. We tried to use mostly free-to-use 2d sprites,
                animations and pixel art for this project. As this was just a
                school project we did take some liberties, however. One of which
                being playing music from the video game Europa Universalis IV in
                the background.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                We definitely did not take ourselves too seriously when
                developing this game, and I think that might be part of why
                developing it was so enjoyable. The game and its art is
                definitely a little silly.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                I mainly worked on the various menus in the game and their
                related functionality (like pausing the game and menu
                navigation). I also made the backdrop by layering two
                see-through textures on a green background. Most of my work I
                did in MS Paint and GIMP, and some would say that it definitely
                shows. To us, it is precisely what gives the game its charm. It
                invokes nostalgia by resembling old, somewhat thrown-together
                web games of the early 2000s.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                The side menu on the right, as well as the heart and coin
                containers, were made entirely in Paint. The side menu links to
                a settings page and the upgrade shop.

              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                When clicking the upgrade icon a shop with various purchasable
                upgrades appears, and the game is temporarily paused. Once
                enough coins are collected by slaying foes, these upgrades
                become available for purchase. The best of these is obviously
                the triple shot upgrade (not all team members agreed on this,
                but it definitely is!).
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                The shop menu itself I also made in Paint, and it is inspired by
                medieval taverns. The buttons, coins and text is rendered on top
                of the menu. I used an old-looking Microsoft font for displaying
                the text. Rendering was initially a bit tricky using LibGDX, but
                we quickly got the hang of it.
              </p>
              <p class="projectParagraphRight">
                I painstakingly hand-edited each shop button icon using my
                keyboard and mouse. When the only other easily available, free
                alternatives are GIMP or mismatching sprites on OpenGameArt, I
                once again opted for trusty old MS Paint. This was definitely a
                reoccuring theme. I know I can be stubborn at times, but as Rema
                1000 states, "The simplest is often the best".

                The main menu is another one of my proud creations! Or in
                hindsight... perhaps not my best work. At the time I remember
                being very happy with making the cross guard of the sword merge
                together with the game's title. Looking back on it now, the menu
                is a little too messy for my liking.

                The Mutliplayer button being boarded up was intended to show the
                users that this feature is a WIP. Some of us wished to continue
                developing the app after our final hand-in. We especially
                thought it would be cool to upload the game to Google Play one
                day. Whether anyone else has worked on the game since, I doubt.
                In other words, multiplayer is likely staying boarded up for
                good.

                Originally we intended to implement a multiplayer feature
                similar to how Bloons TD Battles works: two players fight
                enemies on their own, but can use the in-game currency to send
                more enemies to their foe in an attempt to overwhelm them.

              <p class="projectParagraphLeft">
                We realized there would unfortunately not be enough time to
                complete this feature, so we opted for a simple leaderboard
                system. After losing all of your lives, you can enter a name
                just like in old arcades, and the names with the highest scores
                get displayed on the public leaderboard. The leaderboard was
                stored on a Firebase store. Whether it is still operational, I
                am unsure.

            Overall developing for Android was a lot of fun - probably mostly
            because of my great teammates and the uplifting atmosphere they
            brought. Ashley ECS and LibGDX took some getting used to, but we got
            the hang of it soon enough. This project was a good learning
            experience, and we ended up with a surprisingly addicting game.
