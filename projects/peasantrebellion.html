          <h1>Peasant Rebellion</h1>
          <p>
            Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
            Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying to
            attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay alive
            as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the highest
            possible score. The game ends when the player loses all their lives.
            The player is then prompted if they would like to save their score
            to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade machines, which is
            accessible from the main menu.

            This game was developed by me and my group members during a software
            architecture course last semester. As a part of the requirements, we
            had to thoroughly consider the architecture of the game before we
            started programming. The game was written in Kotlin using Android
            Studio, and it was the first time I developed a mobile application.
            During the project, I was mainly responsible for the UX and UI
            design. This project was a lot of fun, and we ended up with a game
            that was pretty enjoyable to play (at least in my opinion). A quick
            summary of the game can be viewed on Youtube in the video below.
