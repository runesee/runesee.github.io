          <h1>Battleship</h1>
          <p>
            This is my rendition of the well-known game Battleship, written in
            Java. I wrote this game during the TDT4100 course back in 2022. The
            user interface was made in SceneBuilder and uses JavaFX. In the game
            you can play against the computer on either a 7x7 or 10x10 board.
            Games can be saved locally and continued later on. The first player
            (or computer) to sink the other's ships wins.
          </p>

            Main view of the game. Hits on ships are represented by green
            squares, misses by red ones. The user's board is on the right, and
            shows the computer's hits and misses. On the left, the computer's
            board is visible with the user's shots. The user can click the left
            board, followed by the 'Shoot' button to attack the computer. The
            computer will then instantly retalliate, until one player is
            victorious.
          </p>
          <p>
            The computer uses simple logic to attack squares next to its correct
            guesses. If it has expended all adjacent squares, or the game has
            just started, it will guess randomly. It does not derive if it has
            actually sunk any ships.

                This is the start menu. From here the user can continue an
                existing game. This will open up the File Explorer in the game's
                save files directory. When saving a game, the defaultsave.txt
                file is used by default. The save file contains data about the
                board size and game state.

                Clicking 'New game' will take you to the setup page instead. I
                don't think I need to explain what the 'Exit' button does...

          <p>
            In the setup phase, the user will need to place all available ships
            before continuing. This is done by clicking on a ship, then
            selecting a start and end point on the board. Once all ships have
            been placed, the game can be started. The amount of ships depends on
            which board size is selected; the 10x10 board has an extra ship that
            spans five cells.
          </p>

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            After selecting a start point, the available end points will be
            shown in red. Clicking on one of these will place the ship. This
            ensures ships are not placed on top of one another, or span outside
            of the board. If there are no available end points for a ship after
            selecting a start point, the user can reset the board. In the image
            one ship of size 2 has already been placed, and a ship of size 3 is
            currently being placed. All the ship icons have been disabled
            temporarily while the ship is being placed.

                When a game has been won, the winner will be set at the top of
                the view. It will now no longer be possible to shoot, but the
                game can still be saved (for bragging rights).

                The difference in strategy between the player and computer can
                be seen pretty clearly here. The computer's logic is very basic,
                but performs well if the user's ships are grouped close
                together.
