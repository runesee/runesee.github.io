          <h3>Hello, my name is Rune Seeland!</h3>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer student at NTNU Trondheim. I am currently
            on my fourth year of my master's, and this is my portfolio
            containing some of the projects I have worked on as a part of my
            studies or in my spare time. More information about each project can
            be found on their respective pages below, or on my
            <a href="https://github.com/runesee">GitHub page</a>.

            <h3>Middle Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
              Middle Kingdom is a mod I am developing for the video game Hearts
              of Iron IV. HoI4 is a grand strategy game, taking place in the
              20th century. In an attempt to push the limitations of the game
              engine, and because I personally take interest in ancient history,
              this mod instead takes place from 2010 - 1995 BC. The main focus
              of the mod is the middle kingdom of Egypt and its neighbours -
              some of the first civilizations in the world. Players can choose
              to contest the balance of power in ...

            <h3>Peasant Rebellion</h3>
            <p>
              Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
              Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying
              to attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay
              alive as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the
              highest possible score. The game ends when the player loses all
              their lives. The player is then prompted if they would like to
              save their score to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade
              machines, which is accessible from the main menu. This ...

              Kylling&Ris (Chicken&Rice) is a website Ã  la myfitnesspal, which
              lets users search for and register food they have eaten. The
              website allows searching, filtering and sorting a set of data
              gathered from the Kassal.app REST-API containing Norwegian
              groceries. Users kan easily register food elements by clicking the
              related plus button. Afterwards the users can include the weight
              of the product and select a date. The product will then be shown
              in a table, which allows easy navigation between dates through a
              calender. In the table users can remove or edit registered...

              HappyBook is best described as IMDB for books. Users can search
              for and review a set of books, and save books they have read or
              want to read. Admins can add new books and remove existing ones.
