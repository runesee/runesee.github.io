          <h3>Rune Seeland, M.Sc. Computer Science</h3>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer student at NTNU Trondheim. I am currently
            on my fourth year of my master's, and this is my portfolio
            containing some of the projects I have worked on as a part of my
            studies or in my spare time. More information about each project can
            be found on their respective pages below, or on my
            <a href="https://github.com/runesee">GitHub</a>.

            <h3>Middle Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
              Middle Kingdom is a mod I am developing for the video game Hearts
              of Iron IV. HoI4 is a grand strategy game, taking place in the
              20th century. In an attempt to push the limitations of the game
              engine, and because I personally take interest in ancient history,
              this mod instead takes place from 2010 - 1995 BC. The main focus
              of the mod is the middle kingdom of Egypt and its neighbours -
              some of the first civilizations in the...

            <h3>Peasant Rebellion</h3>
            <p>
              Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
              Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying
              to attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay
              alive as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the
              highest possible score. The game ends when the player loses all
              their lives. The player is then prompted if they would like to
              save their score to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade
              machines...

              Kylling&Ris (Chicken&Rice) is a website Ã  la myfitnesspal, which

              groceries. Users kan easily register food elements by clicking the
              related plus button. Afterwards the users can include the weight
              of the product and select a date. The product will then be shown
              in a table, which allows easy navigation between dates through

            <p>
              This is my rendition of the well-known game Battleship, written in
              Java. I wrote this game during the TDT4100 course back in 2022.
              The user interface was made in SceneBuilder and uses JavaFX. In
              the game you can play against the computer on either a 7x7 or
              10x10 board. Games can be saved locally and continued later on.
