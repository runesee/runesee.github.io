          <h3>Hello, my name is Rune Seeland!</h3>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer student at NTNU Trondheim. I am currently
            on my fourth year of my master's, and this is my portfolio
            containing projects I have worked on as a part of my studies or in
            my spare time. There are far too many coding projects from my
            studies to cover here, so I have only included the ones that were
            the most educational to me. More info on each project can be found
            on their respective pages below, or on my GitHub user page linked in
            the footer.

            <h3>Middle Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
              Middle Kingdom is a mod I am developing for the video game Hearts
              of Iron IV. HoI4 is a grand strategy game, taking place in the
              20th century. In an attempt to push the limitations of the game
              engine, and because I personally take interest in ancient history,
              this mod instead takes place from 2010 - 1995 BC. The main focus
              of the mod is the middle kingdom of Egypt and its neighbours -
              some of the first civilizations in the world. Players can choose
              to contest the balance of power in ...

            <h3>Peasant Rebellion</h3>
            <p>
              Peasant Rebellion is a spin-off of the classic Atari game Space
              Invaders. There are starving peasants approaching in waves trying
              to attack you by shooting arrows. The goal of the game is to stay
              alive as long as possible, killing peasants and getting the
              highest possible score. The game ends when the player loses all
              their lives. The player is then prompted if they would like to
              save their score to the global leaderboard, inspired by old arcade
              machines, which is accessible from the main menu. This ...
